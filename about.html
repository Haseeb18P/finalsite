        <h2 id="story-heading">Our Story</h2>
        <p>Boxing Lab was born from a passion for the sweet science of boxing. We began as a small training group in a local park, united by a love for technique, discipline, and community. Over time, weâ€™ve grown into a dedicated facility where every member is guided, challenged, and supported, no matter their level of experience.</p>
